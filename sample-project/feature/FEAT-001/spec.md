# FEAT-001 — Teacher CRUD

Service: `sample-project` · Part of the School Database Management System (SDMS).

Claims are marked `(source: SRD §X)` when they come from
`knowledge/system_requirement_document.md`, and `(source: user, this session)` when
they come from the user in conversation. Anything marked **(unresolved)** is an open
decision, not a settled requirement.

## Problem

SDMS covers academic administration broadly — teacher records, student enrollment,
class scheduling, and grade entry — but there is currently no system at all: nothing
centralizes educator data. Teacher profiles must be accurate because they are a
prerequisite for the downstream workflows that depend on them: assigning instructors
to subjects, scheduling classes, and allowing grade submission.
(source: SRD §1)

Three concrete objectives the teacher module must serve (source: SRD §2.1):

- **Centralize educator data** — one source of truth for all active *and historical*
  teacher profiles.
- **Enable downstream workflows** — produce clean data inputs for class allocation
  and subject grade entry.
- **Auditability & security** — only authorized school administrators may modify
  personnel data, and changes must be auditable.

This is the first feature built in `sample-project`. Nothing it depends on currently
exists — see Dependencies.

## Target user

| Role | Allowed operations | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **School Administrator** | Create, Read, Update, Deactivate | Full management access to all teacher records and their subject/class assignments. |
| **Teacher** | Read (self-profile only), Update (limited) | May view their own profile; may update contact details (phone, email) only. |
| **System / Database** | Soft delete, audit logging | Non-human actor — performs the compliance and integrity operations. |

(source: SRD §3)

Target user for FEAT-001 is the **School Administrator**, acting on teacher records.
A `Teacher` is a *subject* of this feature, not a user of it.

Two things the user confirmed this session qualify that (source: user, this session):

- **No teacher accounts exist.** Teachers are records only; nothing logs in. So
  SRD §3's Teacher self-service role is deferred to whichever feature first gives a
  teacher a login — it is not a live unknown.
- **No administrator distinction exists either.** There is no role model, no
  `is_admin` flag — no authentication or authorization of any kind in this phase.
  "School Administrator" therefore describes **the human doing the job**, not an
  enforced system role.

Read together: FEAT-001's user is real, but nothing in the software identifies or
restricts them. Every authorization requirement in the SRD is deferred — see
Non-goals and the risk note there.

## Success criteria

Each line is an action with an observable result, checkable by someone who was not
involved in this conversation. `[SRD]` = required by the source document; `[new]` =
proposed by the analyst and approved by the user this session. Numbers in `[new]`
lines are tunable defaults, not requirements.

### Create

1. **[SRD]** Admin creates a teacher with all required fields → the record persists
   and is retrievable by the returned `Teacher_ID`.
2. **[new]** `Teacher_ID` matches the agreed format and is unique — creating N
   teachers yields N distinct IDs, with no reuse.
3. **[SRD]** Creating a teacher whose email already exists → rejected with a
   field-level error on `Email`, and **zero rows written**.
4. **[SRD]** `First_Name` / `Last_Name` outside 2–50 characters → rejected, and the
   error names the offending field.
5. **[SRD]** Omitting any required field → rejected, and the error names the field.
6. **[SRD]** `Employment_Status` defaults to `Active` when not supplied.
7. **[new]** Create and its education rows are **atomic** — if the third education
   row fails, no teacher and no orphaned education rows exist.
8. **[SRD — deferred]** On success exactly one onboarding setup link is dispatched to
   the new email. *Deferred: it presumes a teacher account to set up, and no teacher
   accounts exist this phase.*

### Read

9. **[SRD]** Search by `Name` and by `Teacher_ID` each return the expected teacher.
10. **[new]** Search is case-insensitive and matches substrings, not only exact
    values.
11. **[SRD]** The `Active` / `Inactive` filter partitions the set — the two counts
    sum to the total, with no teacher in both. *`On Leave` teachers fall on the
    Active side — see Employment status semantics.*
12. **[SRD]** Pagination defaults to 20 records per page; page 2 returns the next 20
    with no duplicates and no gaps; the final page may be partial.
13. **[new]** The detail view renders with **zero** education rows as a deliberate
    empty state — not an error, not a blank screen.

### Update

14. **[SRD]** Contact details and employment status persist after save.
15. **[SRD]** Attempting to edit `Teacher_ID` or `Hire_Date` → rejected, and the
    stored value is unchanged.
16. **[new]** Each successful update writes **exactly one** audit entry recording
    the before and after values.
17. **[new]** `updated_at` changes only when a field actually changed — a no-op save
    leaves it untouched.

### Deactivate

18. **[SRD]** Deactivate sets `Status = Inactive`; the row still exists and remains
    readable.
19. **[SRD]** No hard-delete path is reachable — the operation is unreachable, not
    merely discouraged.
20. **[SRD — deferred]** A deactivated teacher immediately loses system access.
    *Deferred: there is no access system to revoke from.*
21. **[new]** Reactivation is not available. Any request that would move a teacher
    from `Inactive` back to `Active` or `On Leave` is rejected, and the stored status
    is unchanged. *`Inactive` is terminal in this phase — enforced in the Update path,
    not merely absent from the UI.*

### Authorization

> All three criteria in this group are **deferred** — the user confirmed this session
> that no role model exists of any kind. (source: user, this session)

22. **[SRD — deferred]** A non-administrator cannot reach create, update, or
    deactivate. *No admin distinction exists to test against.*
23. **[SRD — deferred]** A teacher can read their own profile, and cannot read
    another's. *No teacher accounts exist.*
24. **[SRD — deferred]** A teacher can update only phone and email; any other field is
    rejected. *No teacher accounts exist.*

### Education history

25. **[new]** A row's score round-trips exactly — 3.75 stored reads back as 3.75,
    with no floating-point drift.
26. **[new]** Education rows display ordered by study end date, descending.
27. **[new]** Deleting a row removes that row only — the teacher and its sibling rows
    are untouched.
28. **[new]** A score outside 0–100 is rejected with a field-level error.
29. **[new]** An education row whose end date is in the future is rejected.

### Cross-cutting

30. **[new]** Email uniqueness holds under concurrency: two simultaneous creates with
    the same email produce exactly one row. *Enforced in the database, not only in
    application code.*
31. **[new]** `Phone_Number`, when present, matches the project's phone-number
    regex; a non-matching value is rejected. *(The pattern itself is owned by the
    implementation — see Contact fields.)*
32. **[new]** The list view responds within p95 < 500ms at 20 records per page.
    *Invented number — replace with the real target or drop the line.*

### Employment status

33. **[new]** A teacher whose status is `On Leave` is returned by the `Active` filter
    — the status has no behavioural effect on filtering. *(The "can still
    authenticate" half is deferred with the login surface.)*
34. **[SRD]** A teacher whose status is `Inactive` is not returned by the `Active`
    filter. *(The "cannot authenticate" half is deferred.)*

### Concurrency

35. **[new]** A write based on a stale read is rejected: after administrator A saves,
    administrator B's update — built on the pre-save state — fails and returns the
    current record, so B must re-fetch before retrying.
36. **[new]** The check is enforced server-side. A client cannot bypass it by
    omitting a token or version value.

### Deferred — no authentication or roles this phase

The user confirmed this session that neither teacher accounts nor an administrator
distinction exist (source: user, this session). The criteria below are stated SRD
requirements that **cannot be implemented or verified yet**. They are kept visible
rather than deleted, so the feature that adds authentication knows what it inherits:

| # | Criterion | Deferred because |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 8 | Onboarding setup link dispatched on create | presumes a teacher account to set up |
| 20 | Deactivated teacher loses system access | no access system to revoke from |
| 22 | Non-administrator cannot reach write operations | no admin distinction exists |
| 23 | Teacher reads own profile only | no teacher accounts |
| 24 | Teacher updates phone and email only | no teacher accounts |
| 33 (part) | `On Leave` teacher can still authenticate | no login surface |
| 34 (part) | `Inactive` teacher cannot authenticate | no login surface |

Until then, FEAT-001 is a data-management surface with no access control — see the
risk note under Non-goals.

## Non-goals

Explicitly out of scope for this phase (source: SRD §2.2):

- Student registration and enrollment workflows.
- The interface for teachers entering student scores (the Grading Module).
- Payroll and salary management.

Also out of scope for FEAT-001:

- **Hard deletion** of teacher records — the SRD calls it a strict violation (§4.4),
  so there is no delete path to build.
- **Every Subject, Class, and Student dependency** in the SRD — confirmed deferred by
  the user this session. See the scope-reduction table below.
- **Any link from `TEACHER` to another entity**, except its own education history.
  The user confirmed this explicitly: *"no link to any data, except the education
  history."* (source: user, this session)
- **Authentication and authorization.** No teacher accounts, no administrator
  distinction, no role model of any kind — confirmed by the user this session.
  Seven success criteria are deferred as a result (see the table under Success
  criteria). (source: user, this session)

> **Risk — FEAT-001 has no access control.** With no authentication in place, every
> teacher record is readable and writable by anyone who can reach the endpoints —
> including the personal contact details the SRD wants restricted to administrators
> (§2.1, §3). That is acceptable for a first, internal pass, but **this feature must
> not be deployed anywhere real before the authentication feature lands.** Recorded
> here as a known consequence of the deferral, not as a defect to fix in this phase.

### Confirmed scope reduction vs the SRD

The user confirmed this session that all four class/subject-dependent requirements
below are **not implemented in this phase** — teacher CRUD first, no links to other
data. Recorded, not silently resolved (source: SRD §§4.1–4.4; source: user, this
session):

| SRD requires | Status in FEAT-001 |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Primary_Subject` is a required create field | **Dropped** from Create |
| Update flow reassigns classes when status changes | **Dropped** from Update |
| Deactivate validates no active classes depend on the teacher | **Dropped** from Deactivate |
| Update edits a teacher's assigned subjects | **Dropped** from Update |
| Detail view shows Assigned Classes, Taught Subjects, Active Student Lists | **Dropped** from the detail view |

FEAT-001 therefore ships without these SRD requirements, deliberately. The feature
that introduces `SUBJECT` / `CLASS` / `STUDENT` will need to add them back.

## Primary flow

Four operations, all driven by the School Administrator (source: SRD §4, §6).
Steps that depend on Subject/Class/Student are **deferred** — see the table above.

### Create

1. Administrator opens Teacher Management and selects Create.
2. Enters personal, professional, and contact fields: `First_Name`, `Last_Name`,
   `Email`, `Phone_Number`, `Hire_Date`, `Employment_Status` (default `Active`).
   `Primary_Subject` is dropped. (source: SRD §4.1; source: user, this session)
3. Optionally adds one or more education-history records — see Education history.
   (source: user, this session)
4. Validate email uniqueness and field rules.
5. On success: system generates `Teacher_ID` (format e.g. `TCH-2026-001`), and saves
   the record and its education-history rows. Sending the onboarding account-setup
   link is **deferred** — it presumes a teacher account, and none exist this phase.

### Read / View

1. Administrator searches by `Name` or `Teacher_ID`, or opens the list.
   Search-by-`Subject` is dropped. (source: SRD §4.2; source: user, this session)
2. Optionally filters by `Employment_Status`.
3. List displays paginated, 20 records per page.
4. Detail view shows Personal Information and Education History. Assigned Classes,
   Taught Subjects, and Active Student Lists are dropped. (source: SRD §4.2;
   source: user, this session)

### Update

1. Administrator opens a teacher record and edits contact details or employment
   status. Editing assigned subjects is dropped. (source: SRD §4.3; source: user,
   this session)
2. `Teacher_ID` and historical `Hire_Date` are rejected as edits.
3. May add, edit, or remove education-history rows — see Education history.
   (source: user, this session)
4. Save, and write an audit-log entry.

### Deactivate (no delete)

1. Administrator selects Deactivate.
2. `Status` is toggled to `Inactive` (soft delete — the record is retained).
3. The teacher drops out of the `Active` filter.
4. Save log.

Revoking system access is **deferred** — there is no access system to revoke from.
The observable effect lands entirely in step 2, since `On Leave` and `Active` both
remain in the `Active` filter and only `Inactive` leaves it.

## Education history

Added this session by the user — not present in the SRD. A teacher's education is
stored as an owned history table (`teacher_education_history`), not a column on
`TEACHER`, because a teacher accumulates several records over time and per
institution. (source: user, this session)

Each row records, for one institution:

- **Institution** — where the study took place.
- **Institution level** — high school, university, etc. An explicit field on the
  row, not inferred from the institution name.
- **Study start and end date** — the range the teacher studied there.
- **Score** — a numeric score on a **0–100** scale. A score outside that range is
  rejected. (source: user, this session)
- **Focused subject** — a free-text marker of what the teacher specialized in *at
  that institution*. The user's example: *Informatics Engineering* at university,
  *Science* at high school. This is deliberately **not** a reference to the school's
  subject data and **not** linked to any subject the teacher teaches here — it labels
  what was studied. (source: user, this session)

**No "last education" concept.** The user removed it this session: with a history
table present, the UI shows the history; there is no derived "most recent
qualification" field or resolution rule to maintain.

**Date rules** (source: user, this session):

- A row's study start must precede its study end.
- **Future dates are rejected** — a study period cannot extend past today.
- **Overlapping ranges are allowed**, including across different institutions (a
  double degree) and including two rows at the *same* institution. The user confirmed
  same-institution overlap is acceptable. (source: user, this session)

**Row rules:** rows are **optional** (a teacher may exist with none) and are **freely
editable and deletable** after creation (source: user, this session).

This adds one dependency entity. The table's columns, keys, and relationship to
`TEACHER` are `/architect`'s to design in `database.md` — recorded here only as a
requirement.

## Employment status semantics

Three statuses exist (source: SRD §4.1, §5). Their behaviour was confirmed by the
user this session — **only `Inactive` is a functional state; `On Leave` is a label
with no behavioural effect** (source: user, this session):

| Status | Keeps system access | In the `Active` filter | Set by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Active` | Yes | Yes | Default on Create |
| `On Leave` | **Yes** — behaves as active | Yes | Update |
| `Inactive` | **No** — revoked immediately | No | Deactivate (soft delete) |

The user's words: *"On leave only shown status, it keep act as a active."* The user
added the rationale that the label exists because a leave is short-lived — it marks
a temporarily-absent teacher without treating them as gone. (source: user, this
session)

**`Inactive` is terminal (one-way).** The user confirmed this session that
reactivation is explicitly **not** in this phase: once deactivated, a teacher stays
that way. Enforcement is required in the Update path — Update freely edits employment
status otherwise, so without an explicit rejection the one-way rule would be
unenforceable in practice. (source: user, this session; see success criterion 21)

Consequences worth noting for whoever implements this:

- `On Leave` is display/reporting metadata only. It does not gate access, does not
  change the filter grouping, and — with the class-reassignment prompt dropped this
  phase — gates nothing at all yet.
- The SRD's §4.3 treats `On Leave` and `Inactive` alike for the class-reassignment
  prompt. That prompt is dropped this phase, so the SRD's only stated behaviour for
  `On Leave` is currently unimplemented. If a later feature reintroduces it, it will
  need to reconcile "`On Leave` should trigger reassignment" with "`On Leave` acts as
  active" — those pull in opposite directions.
- Only Deactivate produces `Inactive`. Nothing else in FEAT-001 writes that value.

## Contact fields

- **`Email`** — required, unique across the entire database (source: SRD §4.1).
- **`Phone_Number`** — **nullable**, and validated against the project's phone-number
  regex when a value is present. (source: user, this session)
  **(unresolved)** The regex pattern itself is not restated in this spec — the user
  noted the development side already holds it. `/architect` should source the pattern
  from the implementation rather than inventing a second one here.

## Edge cases

Stated in the SRD (source: SRD §4.1, §4.4, §7):

- **Duplicate email on create** — rejected; email is unique database-wide.
- **Hard delete attempted** — a strict violation; hard deletion is disabled to
  preserve student historical grade logs and attendance records.
- **Duplicate profiles under different emails** — mitigated by strict uniqueness
  checks on the identifying attributes.

Deferred with Subject/Class (confirmed this session, so not edge cases FEAT-001
handles): status change while classes are assigned, and soft-delete while active
classes depend on the teacher.

Education history — resolved this session (source: user, this session):

- Optional per teacher — a teacher with zero rows is valid, and the profile must
  render sensibly in that state.
- Rows are editable and deletable, including the most recent one; nothing else in the
  profile derives from education, so removal has no cascade.
- Score outside 0–100 → rejected.
- End date in the future → rejected.
- Overlapping ranges → permitted, at different institutions and at the same one.

Status and concurrency — resolved this session (source: user, this session):

- **Reactivation** — one-way. `Inactive` is terminal in this phase; Update must
  reject a transition out of it (success criterion 21).
- **Concurrent edits** — the lost-update case is handled: a write built on a stale
  read is rejected, and the second administrator must re-fetch before retrying
  (success criteria 35–36).

## Dependencies

- **Identity / authentication provider — not in this phase.** The SRD assumes an
  existing or to-be-integrated IdP via OAuth/SAML (§4.1, §4.4, §7), but the user
  confirmed this session that no accounts and no role model exist. FEAT-001
  therefore has **no** identity dependency to satisfy — it is not waiting on an IdP,
  it simply has no access control. Adding one is a later feature's job, and that
  feature inherits the seven deferred criteria listed under Success criteria.
  (source: SRD §4.1, §4.4, §7; source: user, this session)
- **Education history** (`teacher_education_history`) — a new entity created by this
  feature (see Education history). Institution, institution level, study date range,
  score, and focused subject per row; owned by `TEACHER` and read with it.
  (source: user, this session)
- **Audit log** — §2.1 and §3 require audit trails for personnel changes; no log
  schema is specified (source: SRD §2.1, §3, §6).
- **No other entity links.** The user confirmed this session that `TEACHER` links to
  no other data except its own education history. The SRD's Subject / Class / Student
  dependencies are dropped for this phase (see the scope-reduction table).
  (source: user, this session)

## Priority

Build order, confirmed by the user this session (source: user, this session):

1. **Create + education history** — first, because it is the only step that can
   invalidate the data model. Discovering late that `Teacher_ID` is not unique
   enough, or that the education rows need an extra key, is expensive here and cheap
   now.
2. **Read** — list, search, filter, pagination, and the detail view including its
   zero-education-rows empty state.
3. **Update** — including the two restricted fields and the audit entry.
4. **Deactivate** — last, and smallest: with Class and authentication both dropped,
   it is nothing but a status toggle.

- **This phase:** Teacher CRUD, teacher-only, with education history. (source: SRD
  §2.2; source: user, this session)
- **Deferred:** student registration/enrollment, the score-entry interface, payroll
  (source: SRD §2.2), and every Subject/Class/Student-dependent behaviour listed in
  the scope-reduction table.
- **Teacher self-service** (self-read + limited contact update): role is defined in
  §3 but not listed in-scope — see Open questions.

## Open questions

These do **not** block `/architect` — each is either an implementation-owned detail
or a question that only arises in a later feature. They are recorded so they are not
rediscovered as surprises.

1. **Audit approval** for `Teacher_ID` / `Hire_Date` edits — who approves, and is it
   an approval workflow in this system or an out-of-band process? *The restriction
   itself is confirmed (criterion 15); only the approval mechanism is open.*
2. **Phone regex ownership** — confirm the implementation's existing pattern is the
   one to use, rather than defining a second one here.
3. **Teacher self-service role and all access control** — deferred to the feature
   that first introduces authentication. SRD §3 defines the role; the seven deferred
   criteria in Success criteria are what that feature inherits. Not a live unknown —
   a recorded handoff.
4. **`On Leave` vs the SRD's class-reassignment prompt** — SRD §4.3 treats `On Leave`
   like `Inactive` for reassignment, which contradicts "`On Leave` acts as active".
   Moot this phase (the prompt is dropped); must be reconciled when `CLASS` returns.
5. **Concurrency mechanism** — criteria 35–36 state the requirement; whether it is an
   optimistic version column, an ETag, or a conditional write is `/architect`'s call.
