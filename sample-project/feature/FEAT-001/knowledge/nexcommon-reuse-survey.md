# nexcommon reuse survey — FEAT-001

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-09-28
**Surveyed against:** local clone at `C:\Users\Pongo\Documents\github\nexcommon`, `main` branch.

## Why this document exists

FEAT-001 is the first feature in an empty `sample-project` repo. The
architecture pass applies the reuse-first ladder (does it exist here → shared
lib → stdlib → new code) one level up, at the design-decision level — so this
is the record of *what already existed in `nexcommon`* before anything new was
proposed.

Every reuse decision in `architecture.md` cites a line from this survey. It is
kept as a source document so `/go-dev` and `/qc` can verify a shared-lib claim
against the library itself, rather than taking the architecture doc's word for
it.

The library, not this survey, is authoritative. If they ever disagree, re-read
the clone.

## 1. Audit logging — reused, not built

**Location:** `services/audit_helper/` (`type.go`, `audit_helper.go`,
`audit_builder.go`, `default.go`)

FEAT-001's success criterion 16 requires exactly one audit entry per successful
update, recording before and after values. The spec's Dependencies section notes
"no log schema is specified". A bespoke `teacher_audit_logs` table was the
obvious build — it is not needed.

What the library provides:

```go
func NewAuditHelper(
    enable bool,
    db *sql.DB,
    nats nats.JetStreamContext,
    subject string,
    defaultSchema string,
) AuditHelper

func (a *auditHelper) InitAuditService(
    ctx *context.ContextModel,
    inputStruct interface{},
    serveFunction ServiceFunction,
) (*auditBuilder, error)
```

Mechanics, read from `audit_builder.go`:

- `InitAuditService` opens a `sql.Tx` and hands it to your service function
  (`ServiceFunction func(ctx, tx, input, time) (interface{}, []AuditSystemModel, error)`).
- The before-state snapshot is taken by `GetDataForAuditByIDTx` →
  `GetDataForAuditTx`, which runs:
  `SELECT a.id, uuid_key, row_to_json(a) FROM (SELECT * FROM <schema>.<table> WHERE <filters> FOR UPDATE) a`
- Audit rows are **published to a NATS subject**, not inserted into a table —
  `pushAuditToMessageBroker` → `ab.publisher.nats.Publish(subject, jsonData)`.
- `AuditSystemModel` carries `TableName`, `PrimaryKey`, `UUIDKey`, `Data`
  (the `row_to_json` snapshot), `Action` (`AuditServiceActionDelete=0`,
  `Insert=1`, `Update=2`), `SchemaName`, `CreatedBy`, `CreatedClient`, `CreatedAt`.

### Two consequences that shape our schema

1. **Every audited table needs a `uuid_key` column.** The before-snapshot query
   selects it by literal name. A table without it fails at runtime.
2. **Every audited table needs a `deleted` boolean column.**
   `GetDataForAuditByIDTx` filters `deleted = false` for non-delete actions.

Both are on `teachers` and `teacher_education_histories` for this reason, not
because the spec asked for them.

### Durability caveat — recorded, accepted

`serviceWithAudit` calls `go ab.pushAuditToMessageBroker(...)` — a **goroutine,
fire-and-forget**. `nats.Publish` (not a JetStream ack-required publish) failing
only logs:

```go
_, err = ab.publisher.nats.Publish(ab.publisher.subject, jsonData)
if err != nil {
    log.Error()...Msg("Error Found when publishing data audit")
}
```

So criterion 16's "exactly one audit entry" is **at-most-once**, and the entry
does not exist anywhere until a separate NATS consumer persists it. This was
raised with the user and reuse was chosen anyway — see `architecture.md`. If
audit must become durable, this is the decision to revisit, and the fallback is
a local audit table written inside the same transaction.

## 2. Auth — reused, and it is a no-op by design

**Location:** `controller/whitelist.go`

```go
func (cv ControllerValidator) WhitelistValidator(ctx context.Context, header map[string]string) error {
    return nil
}
```

`WhitelistValidator` performs **no validation at all**. It is nexcommon's
declared idiom for "this route has no authentication" — `controller/type.go`
defines `WHITELIST_TOKEN_VALIDATOR = "${WHITELIST}"`.

This matches FEAT-001's spec exactly: no teacher accounts, no administrator
distinction, no role model. It is not a stopgap auth mechanism — it is the
explicit statement that auth is absent.

Related validators found alongside it, for contrast: `FixedTokenValidator`
(compares a static token), `FixedTokenValidatorWithKong`, `InternalAccessValidator`,
`UserTokenValidator`, `UserAccessValidatorWithKong`.

**Consequence for audit:** with no auth, nothing populates
`ctx.AuthAccessTokenModel.ResourceUserID`, so `AuditSystemModel.CreatedBy` and
`CreatedClient` are empty. Audit entries for FEAT-001 record *what changed*, not
*who changed it*. That is an accepted consequence of the deferral, not a defect.

## 3. Regex — reused, and it resolves the spec's open question 2

**Location:** `regex/regex.go`

The spec's Contact fields section and Open question 2 say the phone pattern
should be sourced from the implementation rather than reinvented, and the user
noted "the development side already holds it". The pattern is not in the
(empty) service repo — it is in the shared library:

```go
const PHONE_NUMBER_WITH_COUNTRY_CODE = "[+][0-9]+[-][1-9][0-9]{8,12}$"
const FORMAT_PHONE_NUMBER_ND         = "^(08|\\+628|\\+62-8|628)(\\d{10,11})$"
const EMAIL_REGEX                    = "^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$"
```

**Selected: `PHONE_NUMBER_WITH_COUNTRY_CODE`** (user decision, this session).

It requires a leading `+` and a literal hyphen — `+62-81234567890` passes,
`081234567890` does **not**. The user was shown this consequence explicitly and
confirmed it. Criterion 31 says phone "matches the project's phone-number
regex"; this satisfies it.

Also available and unused by this feature, listed so they are not rediscovered:
`COUNTRY_CODE`, `IPV4_REGEX`, `NIK`, `NPWP`, `USERNAME`, `NAME_STANDARD`,
`TEXT_ONLY`. Note `NAME_STANDARD = "^[A-Z][a-z]+(([ ][A-Z][a-z])?[a-z]*)*$"` is
**too strict** for `first_name`/`last_name` here — it permits only a
capitalised-lowercase shape, so `MARY-JANE` or `O'Brien` would fail. FEAT-001
uses plain length validation (2–50) per spec criteria 4, not this constant.

---

## 4. HTTP / validation / DTO scaffolding — reused

**Location:** `http/`, `controller/`, `dto/`

The standard endpoint shape, confirmed in `nexcommon-go-standards` and the
library's own `nexcommon.md`:

```go
httpController.WrapService(
    http.NewWarpServiceParam(service, serviceMethod, httpController.WhitelistValidator()).
        APIScope("write").
        PathParams("id").
        DTOOut(http.NewDTOParam(outputDTO)),
)
```

List/count endpoints use `WrapServiceListData` with
`NewWarpGetListServiceParam`, `DefaultDataOrdering("id")`, `DTOOut(...)`.
Get-list filtering/ordering is handled by `dto/in.GetListRequest` + the
validator — filter operators `in`, `lk`, `rng`, `eq`, `be`, `lq`; connector
syntax `name||description&&title`. **Do not hand-parse filters.**

Request flow included free by the controller (nothing to reimplement in a
service): ContextModel → validator → permission/API-scope checks → body decode +
tag validation → path params/headers → idempotency start → call service →
idempotency finish → response formatting → logging.

There is a **third** wrapper, `WrapServiceCountData`, for count-only endpoints.
Not used by FEAT-001 — pagination needs the list + count pair, which
`WrapServiceListData` covers.

## 5. DDL / migration style — matched, not invented

**Location:** `limited_scheduler/queue/db_queue_migration.sql`,
`db_queue_v2_migration.sql`

The house migration format is `sql-migrate`: a `-- +migrate Up` header, a
`-- +migrate StatementBegin` block, and this table idiom —

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS <table>_pkey_seq;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "<table>" (
    id          BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('<table>_pkey_seq'::regclass),
    ...
    created_at  TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at  TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT pk_<compact>_id PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT uq_<compact>_<cols> UNIQUE (...)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_<compact>_<col> ON <table> (<col>);
```

Sequence-backed `BIGINT id`, compact constraint names (`pk_dbqueuev2_id`),
`idx_<compact>_<col>` index names. `database.md`'s DDL follows this shape.

Note the library's own migrations are **simpler** than the project convention —
they carry no `uuid_key` and no audit columns, because `db_queue` is not itself
audited. The `uuid_key`/`deleted` requirement comes from `audit_helper`
(§1), not from this migration style.

## 6. Things checked and deliberately *not* used

| Found | Left alone because |
| :--- | :--- |
| `services/housekeeping_view` | No housekeeping/orphan cleanup in scope — no hard delete exists (criterion 19). |
| `dto/in.GetMultipartDTO`, file-upload path | FEAT-001 has no file fields. |
| `services/scheduler`, `limited_scheduler` | No scheduled work in this feature. |
| `dao.GetListDataDAO` multi-database / sharding / Mongo | Single Postgres, single schema. The composition root should still be *checked* for a second (`PostgresqlView`) section before wiring, per `nexcommon-go-data-standards`. |
| `error2.NewUnBundledErrorMessages` converter pattern | Only relevant once paramaterised/localized errors are needed; field-level validation errors (criteria 3, 4, 5, 28) will likely need it — flag at implementation time. |
| `regex.NAME_STANDARD` | Too strict for the spec's name rules — see §3. |
